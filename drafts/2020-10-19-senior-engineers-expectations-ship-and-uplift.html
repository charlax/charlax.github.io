    <p>This is a summary of a talk I made to my team at Gens de Confiance in Nantes,
France.</p>
<h2>Why is it important to talk about what can be expected from senior engineers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Align expectations within the team: what does it mean to be "senior"?</li>
<li>Set career goals for everyone: what do I need to learn to become "senior"?</li>
<li>Influence behaviors: what's ok &amp; what's not ok?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side note: what about "junior" engineers?</h2>
<p>It makes sense to have a specific job title for "senior": not only does it
validate somebody's career progression, it also serves as a clear signal that
the person has extra responsibilities.</p>
<p>That being said, I don't think we should have a job title "junior engineers" as
the entry level title for software engineering. People might resent their lack
of experience being constantly reminded to everyone by having "junior" in their
title. This might be purely about communication, but I find that "we need
a senior for this job" more positive than "we can't have a junior hold
this role".</p>
<p>Thus, let engineers who are not yet "senior" be called just that: "engineer" or
"developer".</p>
<h2>The technical and the management career track</h2>
<p>Most companies make the distinction between the technical and the management
track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical: Engineer ➡️  Senior Engineer ➡️  Staff Engineer ➡️  Principal Engineer
  ➡️  Fellow</li>
<li>Management: Manager ➡️  Senior Manager ➡️  Director ➡️  VP of Engineering ➡️  CTO</li>
</ul>
<p>In such a two-track system, becoming a manager is <strong>not</strong> a promotion. It is
a completely different role, so it should be considered a lateral move.</p>
<p>In this presentation we will focus on the <strong>technical</strong> track.</p>
<h2>How can we define a senior engineers?</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to define a senior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: while somebody who has no experience has very little autonomy and
  requires direction, a senior enjoy both lots of autonomy and can provide
  direction to inexperienced member of their team.</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong>: <a href="https://frontside.com/blog/2016-07-07-the-conjoined-triangles-of-senior-level-development/">some</a> see senior engineers at the intersection of technical capability
  (rigor, discipline, propensity to ship, etc.), leadership (owner's mindset,
  communication, persuasion, purpose...) and connectedness (mentorship,
  courage, honesty, community...).</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are useful but I find it easier to think about impact level. At what
level do we feel this person's impact the most?</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineer: task, user story</li>
<li>Senior Engineer: project, team</li>
<li>Staff Engineer: company</li>
<li>Fellow: industry</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a feel for what a fellow can achieve and the kind of enormous impact
they can have, here's Google Fellow Jeff Dean's shortened résumé:</p>
<ul>
<li>v1 of Google's ad system</li>
<li>5 versions of Google's core search systems</li>
<li>MapReduce</li>
<li>BigTable</li>
<li>GoogleTranslate</li>
<li>TensorFlow</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, we'll have this definition:</p>
<p><em>Senior engineer</em>: person whose impact is felt throughout the <strong>team</strong> from a technical <strong>and</strong> organisational standpoint</p>
<p>Some companies expect engineers to become seniors within 5-7 years. If they
don't reach that level in this timeframe, they are politely asked to find an
opportunity for growth elsewhere. Also, some companies consider this level
a "career goal", i.e. it is ok to stay at this level your whole career if you
want.</p>
<h2>What to expect from seniors?</h2>
<p>In the shortest form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior engineers <strong>ship</strong> business value</li>
<li>Senior engineers <strong>lift</strong> people up</li>
</ul>
<p>Peter's principle states that people get promoted to their level of
incompetence. In most places, you are promoted when you are doing great at your
current level, which logically implies that at some point you will be promoted
one time too many. To avoid that, it is usually better to promote once you are
effectively performing at the next level. So, even though below we say "senior
engineers do X" and "senior engineers don't do Z", that does not mean you
should not try to do that if you're not senior yet, on the contrary!</p>
<h3>✅ Shipping pattern: rock-solid engineering.</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Col3C6c.jpg" width="70%"></p>
<p>Senior engineers should evidently have strong technical chops. They should have
a huge respect for software as a craft that requires constant learning and self
introspection. They should make the right technical decision most of the time,
based on either data or intuition.</p>
<p>When building, they should take into account functional and non-functional
requirements. In the image above, while the specs might have stated the maximum
weight the bridge should be able to sustain, it might not have specified the
obvious, i.e. that the two end should meet. The same happens in technical
projects: product managers often focus on features, but that does not mean
that the feature should be unstable, or slow, or incorrect. It is your role as
a senior engineer to anticipate.</p>
<h3>✅ Shipping pattern: sharing product and project ideas</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WTfvRiv.png" width="70%"></p>
<p>A senior engineer finds unique ways to leverage technology to bring business
value. For instance, they will deploy an off-the-shelf solution so that the
marketing team can self-serve sending promotional emails.</p>
<p>They see their role as a partnership with product management - not as executing
whatever the PMs have cooked up for them to work on. They will constructively
criticize designs, product roadmaps etc.</p>
<p>This applies to product and platform senior engineers: just because you're
working on infra does not mean you don't have an impact on product, quite the
contrary: how can you help other product engineers ship product features faster
and at a higher level of quality?</p>
<h3>✅ Shipping pattern: leading projects</h3>
<p>In startups, it often feels like everything has to be reinvented, including how
we deliver projects. It often leads to reinventing the wheel, process-wise, and
disguising common sense concepts under preposterous terms.</p>
<p>Yet the concept of project (something that has a deadline) is really at the
core of what engineers work on, and senior engineers should take the lead on
them, owning their success (i.e. shipping a specific level quality at
a specific date with a specific cost).</p>
<p>It starts with understanding their raison d'être and being relentless on
aligning the team on the project's objectives. Identifying blockers, risk and
dependencies (hint: usually the three of them are the same...). Splitting
a large effort into subprojects and subtasks and finding owners for them. Not
being afraid of giving estimates (run away if you ever work on a project
without a deadline - that means nobody cares about it) and communicating
proactively about delays. Communicating all the time to make sure the project
team has the same context. Practicing running meetings.</p>
<p>Leading project is really an end-to-end responsibility: senior engineers should
only stop once the feature has been fully released to customers.</p>
<h3>✅ Shipping pattern: act like a CEO</h3>
<p>"Total ownership" speaks for itself. Senior engineers don't wait to be told.
They have control over their team's destiny.</p>
<h3>✅ Shipping pattern: be the unblocker</h3>
<p>An undervalued skill in engineering (and companies in general): courage.
Courage with perseverance work great together!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn to never, ever accept being blocked; find a way by persuasion, escalation, or technical creativity. (Dan Heller)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>❌ Shipping antipattern: being dogmatic</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/n4eFAHN.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>Not understanding the ETTO principle (Efficiency/Thoroughness Trade-Off) leads
senior engineers to be completely blocked by over-engineering. Technical debt
is not a bad thing if it's maintained (the sad thing about technical debt is
that it's often confused with recklessness). Also: YAGNI (you ain't gonna need
it).</p>
<p>This is also about perception: a strong senior engineer knows that technical
decision needs to be communicated crisply, showing the tradeoffs that have been
weighed. The section "ideas considered but dropped" of an RFC is usually the
most useful.</p>
<h3>❌ Shipping antipattern: thinking only about code</h3>
<p>Senior engineers understand that code is not the only thing that needs to
happen for a project to be successful.</p>
<h3>❌ Shipping antipattern: expecting PMs to do your job</h3>
<p>Product managers do lose sleep over tech debt. Senior engineers understand that
maintaining the technical quality of their platform is their responsibility.
They keep the business team up to date with their upcoming plans for reducing
technical debt, fixing up technical risks, etc.</p>
<h3>❌ Shipping antipattern: all talking, no coding</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, senior engineers are still expected to ship code,
because that's what it takes to deliver most products. Just because it is
important to communicate well does not mean that they should stop coding, lest
they lose their technical edge.</p>
<h3>✅ Lifting pattern: mentor</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ornk03njkdi5mNKJG/giphy.gif" width="70%"></p>
<p>There is no "I" in team, so if you want to move forward you'll have to teach
others (just like you've been taught). Senior engineers share their learnings,
they share their reading ideas, they share their feedback in code reviews, they
share their process in documentation and pair programming.</p>
<p>Being a good mentor is difficult and a skill to acquire. Sometimes mentoring
means giving people autonomy and letting them make their own mistakes. You
can't teach everything and most of the time this is just about setting the
right context so that (1) the mistake is not a career-ending one (2) your
mentee learns from it quickly. Don't teach only the how: explain the why!</p>
<h3>✅ Lifting pattern: lead by example</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jo3eqEd.png" width="70%"></p>
<p>The only person you can change is yourself, so start with <em>that</em> person. Treat
others like how you'd like to be treated. Be rigorous, reliable, and
constructive. Be ok with chores.</p>
<h3>✅ Lifting pattern: investing in your communication</h3>
<p>Just like coding, writing is a skill that takes honing. Writing clearly
and concisely, sounding enthusiastic and motivating... is something worth
working on. If you want to scale your impact, I can't think of a better way
than learning to write effectively.</p>
<p>This is written in 2020, in a world of lockdown and by-default working from
home. Writing skills are key to effective remote work. Companies are starting
to be much more demanding with the quality of written expression during the hiring
process.</p>
<h3>✅ Lifting pattern: be humble</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/4mAB66a.jpg" width="70%"></p>
<p>A great leader is courageous <em>and</em> humble. You were a junior once. You don't
know everything and never will: keep learning, and welcome diverse opinions.</p>
<p>Also: take things with humor. I have been in so many tense situation where just
the right bit of humor can be super effective at defusing things. You can
convey very powerful messages with humor and self-deprecation. Everybody makes
mistake: own them. People will relate to your experience and learn from it.</p>
<h4>❌ Lifting antipattern: deciding by consensus</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/BQhpCKN.png" width="70%"></p>
<p>The more people, the less you can drive by consensus. Appoint a leader and let
them make a decision. Sometimes this leader must be you: accept it, make the
decision, unblock the team. Disagree and commit when you're not the decision
maker: there is a time for discussion, and there's a time for moving forward
with somebody's decision. Identify and escape
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bikeshedding</a>. Don't expect
to be part of every decision.</p>
<h3>❌ Lifting antipattern: being a demotivator</h3>
<p>A senior should strive to uplift others around them, becoming a multiplier for
the team by helping everyone move faster. It is unacceptable for a senior to
be a demotivator: when they become cynical, they bring everybody done, and
because of their experience and impact, they divide everyone's productivity.
Never be that person.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/fP9iJIb.png" width="70%"></p>
<h3>These are high expectations!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but tough is fun!</li>
<li>Yes, but this is how you'll grow your impact!</li>
<li>Great things happen in <strong>teams</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion: putting things into perspective</h3>
<p>I'll always remember what my first boss Thuan Pham (CTO of Uber at the time) said when
I made the switch to engineering management:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, we work with cool technology building great products, but those products have a pretty short impact timeframe: 1-3 years maximum. Above all we work with human beings on a team, and our behavior might impact their career and their life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's put things into perspective: how do you want to be remembered?</p>
