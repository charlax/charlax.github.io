    <p>Starting as a new job as an engineering manager can be tricky. Human beings
fear change, and a new manager usually means more change than a new individual
contributor.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can do your part on making this an easy transition for everyone by
preparing your arrival beforehand. Here are a couple ideas.</p>
<h2>Before your first week</h2>
<p><strong>Research</strong> the company's mission, the job, read up on first day as a manager.
Brush up on what you read preparing for interviews. Be able to articulate the
vision for the company. Talk with customer, learn about what they like/don't
like, use/don't use. Check out its competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare a self introduction</strong>, explain clearly why you joined. Make it fun and
engaging. Rehearse it.</p>
<h2>On your first day</h2>
<p><strong>Show up on time</strong>. Dress appropriately (which might be different from what you were
wearing during interviews). Make sure you have a notebook to take notes.</p>
<p>Ask people if there are meetings on your first week that you should attend.
This will create some structure in your agenda.</p>
<h2>On your first week</h2>
<p><strong>Go through the engineering onboarding process</strong>. It will give you empathy for
the builders on your team. It is critical for you to understand the stack and
team's technological choices (everything is about engineering decisions). Learn
the why. Get the architecture schema. Read code to get an understanding of best
practices and holes. Keep a list of components and technologies you'll have to
research later.</p>
<p><strong>Listen</strong>. Meet with everyone in 1-1, take notes, do very little talking.
Resist the temptation to say "at X, that's how we were doing it". Do not give
advice yet. Defer judgment but listen to emotions. You don't know what you
don't know yet. You might annoy and alienate people. Be honestly and deeply
interested in your coworkers.  Introduce yourself and your background
(enthusiastically and succinctly, do not dwell for too long on your past
achievements), start giving hints at how you envision your role.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare your one-on-one questions</strong>. Here's a list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell me about you</li>
<li>How do you feel?</li>
<li>What's working?</li>
<li>What's holding you back?</li>
<li>What are the current emergencies? How are they tackled? Why are they hard to
   solve?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enjoy the process</strong>. Accepting a new member, especially a manager, is always
a source of anxiety for a team. Fight that with an upbeat attitude. Bring
a gift from your country/region if you're moving. Learn people's name quickly.
Engage with people. Meet with as many as possible face-to-face. Enjoy and leave
time for casual conversation. If you're running around on you first week you're
doing something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Spend time with the previous manager</strong>, or person in charge. Go through team
members. Understand the hiring decision for each team member. Get a list of
stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Meet with your boss</strong>. What are his/her expectations? How will you be
measured?  What does it take to succeed? Who should you meet with? What meeting
should you attend?  Ask for the best way to communicate with them, especially
on your first week.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a "to learn/to read" list</strong>. Prioritize it regularly. Drop things from
it. Review it with your boss.</p>
<h2>After your first few week</h2>
<p><strong>Give feedback.</strong> Find three things that can be improved about the onboarding
or the offer or the interview process. Give the feedback respectfully. Find out
how it's received.</p>
<p><strong>Bring immediate value.</strong> Identify 1-3 things you will secretly and personally
work on to improve your coworkers' life. Learn how to clean up the coffee
machine. Do not go all-in and do not start changing everything.</p>
<p><strong>Define ambitious goals for the next three months.</strong> Review them with your
manager. Setup a three month review.</p>
