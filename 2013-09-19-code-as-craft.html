<p>There are two parts about craftsmanship: one that is intrinsic, and one that is
extrinsic.</p>
<p>The extrinsic part is perhaps the most obvious one: craftspeople <strong>think
holistically</strong> about what they're building. In some sense, what they aim to
accomplish is much bigger than their work. A great woodworker experiences
empathy about her customer and aspires to build something that will delight the
end-user. They not only support a use case, but go much further and let the
produced artifact transcends it. Well-crafted code not only fixes
a problem, it fixes it elegantly. It does not show any rough patch and
feels a natural solution. The consequence of that is when a problem is not
well-defined, or when the timeline set to fix it is not feasible, engineers
should push back - or at least openly share their concerns, just like a good woodworker would
do. Nobody would ever ask a woodworker to take shortcuts when he's building
the house's framework.</p>
<p>The intrinsic part is about <strong>taking pride in one's work and reflecting about
it</strong>.  It's about sharpening one's tools and adding new ones. A great
woodworker would talk for hours about his tools. It's highly probable that his
workshop will be tidy, following the 5S methodology (more about that below).
There's no reason software engineers should feel differently. On the contrary,
they should always be learning, and a great way to learn is to strive for code
quality. When you optimize for speed, you usually don't take time to learn
about your tools and end up misusing them. In the long term, this strategy will
ultimately backfire.</p>
<p>Engineers who take the time to learn about tools, who take time to write
testable &amp; quality code, who take time to carefully think about the
architecture of a service or of an implementation (e.g. following design
patterns) will perhaps be a bit slower in the short term, but this will pay out
ten times in the long term (in quality but also in speed). Striving for quality
in every project, in every task, even mundane (e.g. by automating a test that
could totally be done manually) will enable you to reach the same amount of
quality much faster. Always caring about quality enables continuous
improvement: it might take one hour to learn about how to properly use
a complex but powerful feature of a Python library, but the next time you'll
have 1- probably a much more reliable and fast solution 2- trained your brain
to be constantly learning.  Our industry is moving so fast that this is in my
opinion the only durable strategy.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship is ultimately about the worker as a person. Craftspeople are
those who learn and have fun doing it!</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)">5S</a> (seiri,
seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and shitsuke) applied to software engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorting: remove code that is never run.</li>
<li>Set in order: streamline deployment and management through scripts and
  automation.</li>
<li>Systematic cleaning: remove all TODOs, FIXMEs and temporary code.</li>
<li>Standardising: remove hacks by improving patterns, abstractions and
  architecture.</li>
<li>Sustaining: use continuous integration tools to prevent backsliding.</li>
</ul>
<p>(there's a similar take about 5S applied to software development in <a href="http://blogs.versionone.com/agile_management/2013/07/25/5s-applied-to-agile-software-development/">this
article</a>)</p>
