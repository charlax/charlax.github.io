    <p><strong>Summary</strong>: all lines of code should be covered by a test or <em>explicitly</em>
excluded from test coverage.</p>
<p>What's your test coverage? What do you consider a good test coverage
percentage?</p>
<p>Those questions often get asked during engineering interviews.
It gives the interviewee a sense of how much the company cares about quality.
It's also a good question for the candidate because you can't have a cargo
cult answer. You need to argue. It gives useful insights into one's quality
mindset.</p>
<p>I believe the only right value to track for a test coverage metric is 100% of
the <em>lines that should be covered</em> (<em>not</em> the lines that are written), which
ensures that the lines that you don't want to cover are explicit, and not
implicit.</p>
<p>Please don't skim the articles as you'll find that the point I'm making is pretty common sense. If you still disagree have a look at the response
to common objections at the end.</p>
<p><em>Note: I'm using Python for all the examples below, but the principles are
applicable regardless of the programming language.</em></p>
<h2>Why you should measure test coverage</h2>
<p>If you're not already monitoring test coverage, you should probably start now
(if you don't have tests, that's for another article). Some programming
languages have better support than others. Python has excellent support for it,
through <code>pytest</code> and <code>pytest-cov</code> (using <code>coverage</code> under the hood).</p>
<h3>Test all functionality</h3>
<p>Test coverage allows you to check which lines of code are run while the tests
are executed. If some lines are missing coverage, it means you're not testing
("covering") the underlying behavior. You could introduce a bug, and no test
would fail, which is not desirable. Introducing a bug should ideally trigger a
test to fail.</p>
<p>Let's see a contrived example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
        <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">0</span>  <span class="c1"># let&#39;s say a bug is hidden here</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bread</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_toast</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The test will pass, even though <code>toast("brioche")</code> should fail. Adding
a test for this case will let you find the <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.</p>
<h3>Ensure all tests are run</h3>
<p>Another case for checking is that you want to make sure that your test actually
run. In this contrived example, the tests will pass, even though one of
those test does not do anything:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bread</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_identity</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_identity_noop</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># this is a contrived example, there shouldn&#39;t be any &#39;if&#39; in tests</span>
        <span class="k">return</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you've agreed that you need test coverage, the question remains: what is the
right level of coverage? It is very costly to ensure that absolutely every line
of code is tested. Should it be 80%? 90%?</p>
<h2>Why you should check for 100% coverage</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">TOTAL</span>                                      <span class="mi">18435</span>     <span class="mi">16</span>   <span class="mi">1742</span>      <span class="mi">0</span>    <span class="mi">99</span><span class="o">%</span>

<span class="n">FAIL</span> <span class="n">Required</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">coverage</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">not</span> <span class="n">reached</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Total</span> <span class="n">coverage</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">99</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">86</span><span class="o">%</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>100% is clear cut.</p>
<p>Enforcing 100% coverage requires you to be explicit about the lines that don't
have to be covered ("explicit is better than implicit"). By including the <code>no
cover</code> marker (or whatever your language/coverage lib supports) next to the
code that is excluded from coverage, you allow code reviewers to see your
coverage decisions, and challenge them.</p>
<p>The problem with having a goal that is not 100% is that it leaves room for
interpretation and negotiation. If we're currently at 80% and I bring coverage
at 79.9% because I'm too lazy to test my code (or exclude it from coverage),
then can't we say that it's ok? Explicit markers in the code make the
discussion more factual and objective.</p>
<p>The other problem with something different from 100% is that you might be
adding coverage in one area, and reducing it in another, without knowing it. It
might still lead to 80% coverage - but the reduction in coverage might have
appeared in a crucial area of your code.</p>
<h2>Will 100% coverage prevent any bug from being introduced?</h2>
<p>Of course not. Just because a line is run in a test does not mean it is 100%
correct. You might not be testing all variations. The test might assert the
wrong thing.</p>
<p>Some lines of code should be tested twice to ensure they're correct. See this
contrived example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;croissant&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>  <span class="c1"># this line is covered</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_toast</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All the lines are covered, but I'm not testing that you can't toast <code>"brioche"</code>
and <code>"baguette"</code>. Let's say this behavior is critical (toasting a croissant is
a crime!). Without another test, somebody could change the code like this, and
nothing would break.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">True</span>  <span class="c1"># this line is still covered</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_toast</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore sometime you definitely should test the same line more than once,
testing the failure case and the success case. I'd strongly recommend this for
permission checking for instance.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_toast</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">True</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_toast_cannot</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">can_toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;croissant&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Is this realistic?</h3>
<p>You don't need to cover 100% of the lines you write. Some are not worth
covering as you'll see in the examples below. However, you need to cover 100% of the
lines <strong>you want to be covered</strong>. You need to be explicit about excluding lines
from coverage. Tools such as Python's <code>coverage</code> allow you to specify which
line should be excluded from the coverage.</p>
<p>Using <code>pytest-cov</code> you can achieve this pretty simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">PLUGGED</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">PLUGGED</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_toast</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;bread&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this setup, test coverage will be at 100% even though we did not test the
case where the toaster is not plugged because it is too simple. Writing a test
for this "functionality" would not be worth it. Therefore we explicitly exclude
it from coverage. You should revisit this decision if it becomes more complex
and needs to be tested.</p>
<h2>What can/should be excluded from coverage?</h2>
<p>It depends on your codebase and your quality expectations. Also, as
for any rules, there are exceptions. Examples are writing using Python, but this
is not language-dependent.</p>
<h3>Simple error handling</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover - the handling is too obvious</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;no bread provided&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Anything more complicated than that should probably be covered.</p>
<h3>Proxy functions</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">external_lib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Toaster</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover - we&#39;re just proxying</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Toaster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It also applies to thin wrappers you might have in front of your
dependencies.</p>
<h3>Code as configuration</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_temperature</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover - no complexity there</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">3</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Simple early return/continue</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breads</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">breads</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover - simple early continue</span>
            <span class="k">continue</span>

        <span class="o">...</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If the early return/continue is part of the logic, or leads to complicated side
effects, it should be tested.</p>
<h3>Code that is too difficult to test (rare)</h3>
<p>In rare cases, it is a perfectly fine decision to exclude some code from
coverage if the tests are too expensive to write (because of the required
setup, or the use of an external library, for instance). Again - this should
only be in rare cases, for instance when you're using an external library that
is not easy to mock. In most cases, if your code is complicated to test that
probably means it needs to be refactored - easy-to-test code is usually better
designed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">packagea</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">A</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">packageb</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">B</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover - too complicated to test</span>
    <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">expensive_function_that_needs_to_be_mocked</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>  <span class="c1"># lots of code</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Make sure that this code is easy to test manually, and that the code calling it
is well tested.</p>
<h3>Debugging/manual test code</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

        <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ok&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>What should be covered</h2>
<p>Here's a list of things that should be covered, ideally more than
once.</p>
<h3>Branches</h3>
<p>If your language supports it, make sure you test all branches:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>        <span class="c1"># 1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>          <span class="c1"># 2</span>
        <span class="n">bread</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;toasted_baguette&quot;</span>   <span class="c1"># 3</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bread</span>                     <span class="c1"># 4</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_toast_baguette</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;baguette&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;toasted_baguette&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You're technically at 100% code coverage, but the case where <code>bread</code> is not
"baguette" and the <code>if</code> is never evaluated to False: line 2 never jumps to line
4. If you activate branch coverage, it will be flagged as a partial branch, and
   coverage won't be at 100%. To fully test it, you'll need:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>        <span class="c1"># 1</span>

<h3>New functionality (even for proof-of-concept)</h3>
<p>While it might be tempting to exclude new prototyping code from coverage, I
think it's a bad idea because that's one more thing to remember and track.
Moreover, once a feature is shipped, we usually move on to the next feature and
never clean up our tests. So, it's safer to get into the habit of covering all
new code.</p>
<h2>How to get to 100%</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start tracking and displaying the test coverage. Make it easy to find
   uncovered lines (for instance with an HTML report). Have an open discussion
   with your team.</li>
<li>Ensure all new code is fully covered, and that coverage can only strictly
   increase. Some Github bots let you enforce this.</li>
<li>Before writing new code, check the coverage of the existing functionality,
   and bring it to 100%. Try to structure your tests so that running a single
   test file (e.g. <code>test_toaster.py</code>) will cover 100% of its associated code
   file (<code>toaster.py</code>). It allows for quicker iterations.</li>
<li>Once you're at 100%, use your preferred tool's configuration to fail the
   tests if coverage is not 100%.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Answer to common objections</h2>
<h3>100% test coverage does not mean you're testing everything right.</h3>
<p>Absolutely - this point is explicitly stated in this article. I even give an
example situation showing how just checking the test coverage leads to missing
an important test.</p>
<p>100% test coverage does not make your code invulnerable, and it should
evidently not be your only metric. This article is only about the test coverage
metric.</p>
<h3>A test suite that covers 80% is pretty good</h3>
<p>Absolutely. It is a good number and a good goal for any
codebase.</p>
<p>However, what about that remaining 20 %? Why are they not tested? Will it be clear
in 2 months why they were not tested? In 6 months? In a year? While it may make
perfect sense not to test them, you should be explicit about that decision and
keep the reason in the code.</p>
<p>If you don't keep the test coverage <em>metric</em> at 100%, then you leave it up to the
code reviewer to challenge your test coverage assumption.</p>
<h3>100% is a blanket rule that leaves no room for negotiation</h3>
<p>Once again, the goal is not to cover 100% of the lines of code - it would be
almost impossible. Thanks to <code>no cover</code> markers, you can still decide to
exclude code from coverage. It actually makes this negotiation explicit in the
code, as opposed to implicit during the code review phase coverage.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">toast</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;...&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's say you're fixing a bug in this code, and you find out that the <code>if</code>
branch is not covered. You're left to wonder why. The developer did not have
enough time? They decided it was too trivial to need a test?</p>
<p>With an explicit marker, the intent is clear and gives you insight with what is
considered appropriate coverage for <em>this</em> codebase:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">toast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bread</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">toast</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brioche&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover, trivial error case</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;...&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>It is not feasible in an old codebase</h3>
<p>Right, that's probably the case. However, this is not different from proper
testing, monitoring, logging practices. Decide if it's important, then start
with something attainable that brings you closer to the goal, and iterate.</p>
<p>Also, if it is not a desirable goal for the codebase, then for sure don't monitor
test coverage!</p>
<h3>Enforcing 100% test coverage leads to bad tests</h3>
<p>It bears repeating: this is not about testing 100% of the lines; this is about
keeping the code coverage metric at 100%. I am not sure how that would lead to
bad tests.</p>
<p>Putting too much focus on one particular metric might lead to gaming behavior.
That does not mean that no metric you should be enforced. I believe that there
isn't enough material and training about what it takes to write good tests.
This is beneficial regardless of whether you enforce test coverage. Also, the
more you talk about test coverage, the more you iterate and learn about
what it takes to write good tests in your language and codebase.</p>
<p>What's sure is that it is straightforward to write bad tests. It takes a lot of
skills, experience, and hygiene to write great, maintainable tests. That's a
topic for another article.</p>
<h3>100% coverage only matters for languages without a type checker</h3>
<p>No. Sure, a type checker might catch some classes of bugs that would require a
test in a language without type checking, but you still need to test
correctness (among others).</p>
<h3>You're creating blind spots</h3>
<p>Unless you're reviewing your test coverage report after every single commit,
leaving explicit markers in the code and keeping the metric at 100% is actually
a much safer practice.</p>
<p>When working in code that has been excluded, you'll immediately see the <code>no
cover</code> marker, perhaps with a comment explaining why the code is excluded. This lets you reconsider the coverage decision.</p>
<p>Any regression in coverage will break the tests.</p>
<h3>You should not exclude code from coverage because of setup cost</h3>
<p>This article is not about end-to-end vs. unit testing. I have provided some
examples of code that I sometimes exclude from testing, but your mileage may
vary.</p>
